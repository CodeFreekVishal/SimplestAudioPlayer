# SimplestAudioPlayer
This is the simplest form of Audio Player to be made using Android. Nothing much extraordinary. But a good reference for those who are new to Android and wish to have a look at it. Its open for changes if you wish to make any...

As you can see, only the important files are present that are needed to be changed in a project. No change to be made in
Strings.xml or even in main.xml from menu folder...

So enjoy the music and make suitable changes if you wish to :)
